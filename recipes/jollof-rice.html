        <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped green onion for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, Fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until the onion starts to soften, about 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric. Continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.</li>
        <li>Turn heat to high, stir in the tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir the rice.</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, turn off the heat and set a timer for 12 minutes. Allow the rice to sit, keeping the lid on.</li>
        <li>After 12 minutes, remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork, separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro.</li>
    </ol> 
    <h4>Cook's Note:</h4>                        
    <p>
    If rice seems to be a little undercooked at this point, stop fluffing. Pat the rice down gently with the back of the fork, cover tightly again, and set heat to medium low. Cook for another 5 minutes, and check again.
